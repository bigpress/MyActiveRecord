Changelog 0.3 - 0.4
 
1. BUG FIXES
 	1.1	Error is triggered when connection fails or database cannot be selected
 	1.2	If Class cannot be found or table cannot be found to match class script
 		reports error instead of hanging. (this fixes bug introduced in 0.3)
 	1.3 Removal of error notices on save dues to presumption about existance of 
 		variables
 
2. FIND_CHILDREN() IMPROVEMENTS
Added new paramaters to the find_children() method. First the full 
complement of Where, OrderBy, Limit and Offset a-la FindAll(). Second, the 
addition of a ForeignKey paramater. Useful if you have a table with a
two foreign keys pointing to the same table, and so you need to use a 
different name to parent_table_id
 
3. ADDED FREQDIST() WHERE and LIMIT paramaters
e.g. print_r( MyActiveRecord::FreqDist( 'Order', 'total_lines', "date BETWEEN '2005-01-01' AND '2006-01-01'" ) )
